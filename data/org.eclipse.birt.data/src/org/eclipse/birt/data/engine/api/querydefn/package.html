This package is part of the Data Engine public API, and contains 
default implementation of request interfaces in 
{@link org.eclipse.birt.data.engine.api}. <p>

The classes in this package implement interfaces for 
the Data Engine API's data source designs, data set designs and query definitions.
A Data Engine API consumer who does not provide its own implementation of 
those interfaces may use the classes here to compose Data Engine API requests.

@since 1.0

@see org.eclipse.birt.data.engine.api
