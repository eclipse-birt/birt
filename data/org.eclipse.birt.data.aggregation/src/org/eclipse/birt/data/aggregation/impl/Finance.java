	 * 
	 * The double-declining balance method computes depreciation at an
	 * accelerated rate. Depreciation is highest in the first period and

	 * calculate depreciation for a period: ((cost-salvage) - total depreciation
	 * from prior periods) * (factor/life)
	 * 
	 * Change factor if you do not want to use the double-declining balance
	 * method. Use the VDB function if you want to switch to the straight-line
	 * depreciation method when depreciation is greater than the declining
	 * balance calculation.

	 * @param due
	 *            is the number 0 or 1 and indicates when payments are due. If
	 *            type is omitted, it is assumed to be 0.
	 * @param fv
	 *            is the future value, or a cash balance you want to attain
	 *            after the last payment is made. If fv is omitted, it is
	 *            assumed to be 0 (the future value of a loan, for example, is
	 *            0).
	 * @param pmt
	 *            is the payment made each period; it cannot change over the
	 *            life of the annuity. Typically, pmt contains principal and
	 *            interest but no other fees or taxes.
	 * @param nPer
	 *            is the total number of payment periods in an annuity. For
	 *            example, if you get a four-year car loan and make monthly
	 *            payments, your loan has 4*12 (or 48) periods. You would enter
	 *            48 into the formula for nper.
	 * @param pv
	 *            is the present value - the total amount that a series of
	 *            future payments is worth now.
	 * @param guess
	 *            is your guess for what the rate will be. If you omit guess, it
	 *            is assumed to be 10 percent. If RATE does not converge, try
	 *            different values for guess. RATE usually converges if guess is
	 *            between 0 and 1.
	 * @return the interest rate per period for an annuity
	 * 
	 * Remark
	 * 
	 * Make sure that you are consistent about the units you use for specifying
	 * guess and nper. If you make monthly payments on a four-year loan at 12
	 * percent annual interest, use 12%/12 for guess and 4*12 for nper. If you
	 * make annual payments on the same loan, use 12% for guess and 4 for nper.
