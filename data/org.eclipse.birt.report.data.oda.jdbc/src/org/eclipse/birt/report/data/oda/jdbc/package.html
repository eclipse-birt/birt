[<b>Non-API</b>] This package contains classes that implement the JDBC-ODA Bridge Driver. 
<p>
ODA (Open Data Access) is the standard data extension protocol for providing JDBC
data access to BIRT. The JDBC-ODA Bridge Driver translates ODA API requests to JDBC
calls, thus enabling access to JDBC data sources in BIRT reporting.
<p>
Note: <i>The implementation classes are <b>not</b> public APIs.  
<br>Backward compatibility support in future releases is not guaranteed.</i>
