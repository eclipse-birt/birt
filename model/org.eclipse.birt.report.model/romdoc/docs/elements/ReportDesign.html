<h1>ReportDesign</h1>

<p>The report design element represents report as a whole.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>

<p>The report design element contains the information about 
a report design. It represents the entire set of design information stored in a 
BIRT report design file.</p>

<p>The report design defines properties that describe the 
design as a whole. Report design properties do not inherit because a design 
cannot extend another design.</p>

<h4>Scripting Summary</h4>

<p>Runtime object: <code>report </code>
(global variable)</p>

<p>Design object: <code>report.design</code></p>

<h3>See Also</h3>

<p>Library element</p>

<h2 class="property">refreshRate</h2>

<p>The refresh rate when viewing the report.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The refresh rate when viewing the report. The viewer will 
automatically rerun and redisplay the report. The rate is given in seconds. A 
rate of 0 means no refresh.</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<p>Default value: <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">0 (the 
report does not refresh)</span></p>

<h3>See Also</h3>

<h2 class="property">cheatSheet</h2>
<p>A string containing the file name of the cheat sheet.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>A string containing the file name of the cheat sheet used with this design.</p>

<h2 class="property">displayName</h2>
<p>Display name of the report design</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>The localized display name for the report design.</p>


<h2 class="property">displayNameID</h2>
<p>Resource key for the localizable display name property.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Resource bundle key for the display name property, the localized display name value will
be looked up from a resource file relating to the current locale.</p>

<h2 class="property">eventHandlerClass</h2>
<p>The full qulified name of the event handler class.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Full quilified name of the event handler class, used to specify an external Java class
which define the scripting behavior that will be executed at runtime.</p>

<h2 class="property">iconFile</h2>
<p>The design icon/thumbnail file path</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>The design icon/thumbnail file path</p>

<h2 class="method">beforeFactory</h2>

<p>Perform initialization before opening the report document for writing.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Called at the start of the Factory after the initialize(&nbsp)
method and before opening the report document (if any).</p>

<h3>See Also</h3>

<p>Module element <code>initialize</code> 
method</p>

<p><code>afterFactory</code> method</p>

<h2 class="method">afterFactory</h2>

<p>Perform initialization before opening the report document for writing.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Called at the end of the Factory after closing the report 
document (if any). This is the last method called in the Factory.</p>

<h3>See Also</h3>

<p><code>beforeFactory</code> method</p>

<h2 class="method">beforeRender</h2>

<p>Called before starting a presentation time action.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>BIRT calls this method at the start of each 
presentation-time activity such as convert a page, print a report, extract data, 
etc. Presentation activities are usually done in repose to a client request 
coming into the Presentation Engine. Code is likely to be specific to the 
deployment platform.</p>

<p>BIRT may cache the same report session across multiple 
render actions. For example, if a user wants to view pages 1 and 2, see the 
table of contents, then do a search, the Presentation Engine may elect to keep 
the report loaded and the JavaScript session in effect. This allows an 
application to perform costly presentation-time initialization once, simply keep 
a flag that indicates whether initialization has already been done by another 
render action.</p>

<p>If the report is being run and rendered in a single pass, 
then this method is called after the call to <code>
beforeFactory</code>. If the rendering operation is being done on a report 
previously created, then this method is called just after the initialize method.</p>

<p>The Presentation Engine may choose to cache a report 
design and script session across multiple render requests. In this case, each 
render operation will trigger a call to <code>beforeRender</code> 
and <code>afterRender</code>. The <code>
initialize</code> method will be called only when the report is first loaded.</p>

<h3>See Also</h3>

<p><code>initialize</code> method</p>

<p><code>afterRender </code>method</p>

<h2 class="method">afterRender</h2>

<p>Called after completing a presentation time action.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>BIRT calls this method at the completion of each 
presentation-time activity such as convert a page, print a report, extract data, 
etc. Code is likely to be specific to the deployment platform.</p>

<p>If the report is being run and rendered in a single pass, 
then the call to <code>afterFactory</code> will precede the 
call to <code>afterRender</code>.</p>

<h3>See Also</h3>

<p><code>beforeRender</code> method</p>
	
<h2 class="method">initialize</h2>

<p>Called when the report starts executing in either the 
Factory or Presentation engine.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>BIRT calls this method before calling any other method in 
the design. </p>

<p>BIRT calls this method at the start of the Factory and 
Presentation engines, just after loading the imports, before opening the report 
document. Implement this method to define global functions, objects, Java 
imports and other resources used throughout the report.</p>

<p>Libraries can also contain an init script and imports. 
BIRT executes these scripts in the following order:</p>

<ul>
<li>For each library, in the order that the library is included:</li>

<ul>
<li>Locate, read and execute the imported scripts in the order they appear in 
the Code Modules element.</li>
<li>Execute the <code>initialize</code> script.</li>
</ul>

<li>For the report design itself.</li>

<ul>
<li>Locate, read and execute the imported scripts in the order they appear in 
the Code Modules element.</li>
<li>Execute the init script.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<p>In general, the <code>initialize</code> 
method of a report design or library can reference resources defined in the
<code>initialize</code> script of any included libraries, but 
not visa-versa. This is the generally accepted meaning of an include.</p>

<h2 class="slot">body</h2>

<p>The visual layout sections within the report.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The body portion of a design contains a list of the 
visual report content. Content is made up of one or more sections. A section is 
a report item that fills the width of the page. Sections represent relatively 
independent divisions within the report. In CSS terminology, a section is a 
block-level element.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The simplest design 
contains a single section. However, sophisticated designs can contain any number 
of sections.</span></p>

<p>The body contains any 
number of sections, in any order.</p>

<h3>See Also</h3>

<h2 class="slot">components</h2>

<p>Reusable report items defined in this design. Report 
items can extend these items. Defines a &quot;private library&quot; for this design.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This slot defines reusable report items defined in this 
design. Report items can extend these items.</p>

<p>A report developer may want to use the same image, text, 
label or other item in several places within in the report. Instead of copying &amp; 
pasting, the developer can instead define the element once in the components 
slot. Then, he can use the component to create the various instances.</p>

<p>Using a reusable component helps reduce maintenance costs 
because changes are made in only one place, rather than across several copies.</p>

<p>This slot defines a &quot;private library&quot; for this design. 
Components that are used by several reports appear in a &quot;shared&quot; library file.</p>

<p>The following rules apply to the components slot:</p>

<ul>
<li>All report items in the component area must have a name. (This rule 
applies only to items directly in the component area, not to items nested inside 
of other items.)</li>

<li>All report items share a single name space, including those in the 
Components and Body.</li>

<li>Items in the Components area can extend from other items in the 
Components area of the same type. In the design file, the base components must 
physically appear before derived items.</li>

<li>Any type of report item can appear in the Components area.</li>

<li>Only report items can appear in the components area. Master pages, 
styles, data sets, data sources, parameters and other elements cannot appear.</li>

<li>Report items in the components area can contain other items if their 
definition allows. For example, a grid can contain other items.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="slot">styles</h2>

<p>List of user-defined styles used to format elements in the report.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>User-defined styles used to format elements in the 
report. Each style must have a unique name within the set of styles for this 
report.</p>

<h2 class="slot">parameters</h2>

<p>A list of Parameter elements that describe the data that the user can enter when running the report.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A list of parameter elements that describe the data that 
the user can enter when running the report. BIRT supports four kinds of 
parameters identified above. The design can also include parameter groups that 
organize parameters visually.</p>

<p>The order of parameters within this slot in the design 
file determines the order that they will appear in the requester UI.</p>

<p>The parameters property provides a &quot;flattened&quot; list of 
parameters. Each parameter identifies the group (if any) to which it belongs.</p>
<p>Parameter values are also available using the
<code>params</code> global variable.</p>


<h2 class="slot">dataSources</h2>

<p>The connections used by the report.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This slot holds the list of data sources defined within 
the report itself. Each data source must have a unique name. The order of items 
within this slot is unimportant.</p>

<h3>See Also</h3>

<h2 class="slot">dataSets</h2>

<p>Data sets (queries) defined in the design.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This slot holds the list of data sets defined within the 
report itself. Each data set must have a unique name. The order of items within 
this slot is unimportant.</p>

<h2 class="slot">scratchPad</h2>

<p>TBD</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>TBD</p>


<h2 class="slot">templateParameterDefinitions</h2>

<p>Stores the reusable template definitions.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Slot that stores the reusable template definitions, report items/data set/data source can
be created from a template definition</p>


<h2 class="slot">pageSetup</h2>

<p>The layout of the master pages within the report.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The page setup defines the way that the report will 
appear when printed. It consists of a master page that defines the page size, 
page &quot;decoration&quot;, margins and so on. Some reports need to use different master 
pages, perhaps to have the first page of the report appear in letterhead, with 
the remaining pages on plain paper. Other reports may be printed and bound, 
requiring differing page layout for the left and right pages.</p>

<p>A report can omit the page setup information. If so, page 
setup is taken from a library, if provided. If the library is not provided, or 
does not have a page setup, or the master page does not have page dimensions, 
then the setup comes from BIRT preferences, or from locale-specific defaults.</p>

<p>If the user lists multiple master pages, but no page 
sequences, then BIRT uses the first master page by default. If the user defines 
one or more page sequences, then BIRT uses the first page sequence by default. 
Other than these two cases, the order of elements within the page setup slot is 
unimportant.</p>

<p>This slot defines a name space; the name of each master 
page and page sequence must be unique across the set of other page setup 
elements.</p>

<p>Only the simple master page is available in the first 
release, and the design can contain at most one simple master page in the first 
release.</p>

<p>The page setup can contain zero or more master pages (of 
either type) and zero or more page sequences (of either type). The simplest 
report provides no master page. It will appear with the default pages size and 
margins, and with no page header or footer.</p>
