<h1>OdaDataSet</h1>

<p>An extended data set retrieved by a query through an ODA driver that
implements the Open Data Access (ODA) interfaces.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The ODA Data Set represents an extended data set that implements the Open
Data Access (ODA) interfaces. The ODA interface defines a rich set of meta-data
attributes available to the BIRT Designer to help the user build the report.
The ODA Data Set definition contains the minimum amount of information
necessary to access the desired data source. The rest of the available
meta-data information is obtained from the ODA driver when needed.</p>

<p>The ODA Data Set element defines a single ODA data set of a specific type.
An ODA Data Source may support one or more types of ODA data sets.</p>

<p>Both the data set element and the ODA driver can provide column definition
and hints. Data-access attributes, such as name and type, are typical derived
attributes. They are defined in the inherited <code>resultSet</code> definition, and are
used only if the run-time driver cannot provide such meta-data. </p>

<p>An ODA driver may statically define driver-specific data set query
properties by defining the <code>property</code> element in the ODA data
source extension point (<i>org.eclipse.birt.data.oda.dataSource</i>).  
See the BIRT Extensions functional
specification document for more detail description. By implementing the
extension point, an ODA driver's extension plug-in manifest (plugin.xml) could define
static driver-specific data set query properties. BIRT uniquely identifies each
extension-defined property within the scope of its ODA extension.  BIRT supports 
these properties as extended
ROM properties with all their built-in features, such as direct editing from
the BIRT designer's property sheet. For ease of segregating these
driver-specific properties in the property sheet, one could define them within
a <code>propertyGroup</code>
element with a group display name like &quot;Query Properties&quot;.  Such grouping is purely for display in a
property sheet.  Each property in a
display group is treated as a top-level property, whose grouping is not visible,
when it is accessed programmatically.  At Factory time, these static extension-defined properties are passed in
name-value pairs to the ODA driver as a query's run-time properties.</p>

data source extension plug-in manifest.</p>

<h2 class="property">extensionID</h2>

<p>The ID of a data set type supported by the ODA data source extension.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The fully qualified ID that uniquely identifies the type
of ODA data set definition in the BIRT environment.  It is defined in the ODA data
source extension plug-in manifest (plugin.xml) in the <code>dataSet.id</code>
attribute. Its value is optional
if the ODA extension supports only one type of data set.</p>

<h3>See Also</h3>

<h2 class="property">queryText</h2>

<p>The static query text to execute.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The query text used in opening a data set. Specific ODA driver defines the
format of this string. The query text is passed through to the ODA run-time
driver to prepare a query for execution.</p>

<h3>See Also</h3>

<h2 class="property">resultSetName</h2>

<p>Identifies which result set to access if a query returns multiple result
sets.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Some ODA drivers provide multiple named result sets from a single query. In
the first release, BIRT can access only one of these result sets. This property
identifies which named result set to access. The inherited <code>resultSet</code>
definition, if specified, is for this result set. </p>

<p>Required if multiple result sets are available, and a result set must be accessed
by name. This property is not applicable when multiple result sets are returned
in sequence; the first result set is treated as the primary result set.</p>

<h3>See Also</h3>

<h2 class="property">privateDriverProperties</h2>

<p>A dynamic list of name-value structures that specify private data or
attributes specific to the ODA data set query.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A dynamic list of name-value structures (<code>ExtendedProperty</code> structures) that
specify private run-time data or attributes specific to the ODA data set. This
is an optional element that an ODA driver may use to store and pass pertinent
driver-specific attributes from its designer tool to the run-time driver. The
content of this element is specific and private to an ODA driver, whose
designer tool can dynamically define and update them as appropriate. These
name-value pairs are stored in the report design file as a persistent service,
and are passed to the ODA driver at Factory time as a query's run-time
properties.</p>

<p><code>ExtendedProperty</code> structure</p>

<h2 class="property">parameters</h2>
<p>Defines the data access attributes of the list of input and/or output parameters.</p>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Many data sets allow parameters, which can be of input and/or output modes. For some, the user must define the parameters as part of the data set definition. For other data sets, the driver itself can provide the set of parameter definitions from the information available in a data set query. In the latter case, parameter definitions are derived data and <i>are not</i> stored in the parameter definition.</p>
<p>Some drivers refer to a parameter by position. Others can refer to a parameter by name. Also, for some data sets, the data set definition can omit parameter definitions for optional parameters not used within the report. &nbsp;Not all parameter properties are required. If a property is omitted. BIRT assumes that the data set implementation can provide it at run time. If the driver cannot provide the information, then a runtime error occurs.&nbsp;This is an optional list of data set parameter definitions, used only when the underlying data provider cannot provide this information.&nbsp;When contradicting meta-data are found between those provided dynamically by a data provider and&nbsp;those specified in a data set definition, the data provider&iuml;&iquest;&frac12;s meta-data takes precedence.</p>

<h2 class="property">resultSet</h2>
<p>Defines the columns of the expected result set.</p>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Defines the data access attributes of&nbsp;the list of columns in the expected primary result set. This is an optional list of result set column definitions, used only when the underlying data provider cannot provide this information.&nbsp;When contradicting meta-data are found between those provided dynamically by a data provider and&nbsp;those specified in a data set definition, the data provider&iuml;&iquest;&frac12;s meta-data takes precedence.</p>
