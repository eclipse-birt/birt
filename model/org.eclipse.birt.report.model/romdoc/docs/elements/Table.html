<h1>Table</h1>

<p>Presents data from a data set in using a tabular layout.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A table presents the rows from a data set in a tabular 
arrangement. The columns property is optional and defines the columns. The 
header appears at the top of the table, and on each new page. The table can 
contain groups. The footer displays totals and appears at the bottom of the 
table. The detail appears for every row in the data set.</p>

<p>A table can omit the data set. In this case, it displays 
a set of rows defined by its container. See the &quot;Combining a List and a Table 
with a Single Data Set&quot; section below for details.</p>

<h2 class="property">caption</h2>

<p>Text to appear as a table caption in HTML.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This property provides text to appear as the table 
caption in HTML. The text can be localized. From the HTML 4.0 spec:</p>
<p>When present, the CAPTION element's text should describe the 
nature of the table. ? Visual user agents allow sighted people to quickly grasp 
the structure of the table from the headings as well as the caption. A 
consequence of this is that captions will often be inadequate as a summary of 
the purpose and structure of the table from the perspective of people relying on 
non-visual user agents.</p>

<h2 class="slot">header</h2>

<p>Rows to appear at the top of the table, and 
optionally at the top of each page.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The table header appears at the top of the table, and 
optionally at the top of each page. The table header usually contains column 
headings. Unlike a list, the table header is not designed to display 
introductory information. Instead, to display such information, use the table 
combined with a list as described in the &quot;Combining a List and a Table with a 
Single Data Set&quot; section below.</p>

<h2 class="slot">footer</h2>

<p>Rows to appear at the bottom of the table.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The footer defines a set of rows to appear at the bottom 
of a table. The footer often contains totals.</p>

<h3>See Also</h3>

<h2 class="slot">groups</h2>

<p>Level breaks within the data. Each has its own header 
&amp; footer.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Groups provide a way of organizing data within a table. 
Groups appear from the most general (outermost) to the most specific 
(innermost). For example, a table can display sales by sales region and sales rep. The region 
and rep represent groups. The region is the outermost group. The rep is the 
innermost group.</p>

<h3>See Also</h3>

<h2 class="slot">detail</h2>

<p>Rows to display for each row in the data set.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The detail rows appear for each row in the data set. Rows 
can be conditionally selected. For example, an accounting report can display a 
different row for debits vs. credits.</p>

<h3>See Also</h3>

<h2 class="slot">columns</h2>

<p>A list of Column elements that describe the table 
columns.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This slot describes the columns within the table. 
This column definitions are optional. If omitted, BIRT infers the columns from the table 
structure itself, and BIRT will size the columns based on their contents. If 
provided, then the table must contain no more than the number of columns 
described. Use this property when you want to control the size, color, border, 
or other properties of each column.</p>
