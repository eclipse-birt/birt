<h1>Module</h1>

<p>Report design information common to report designs and 
libraries. This is most of the report except for the body.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The module element describes the common characteristics 
between libraries and designs. It provides a wide variety of properties to help 
people understand the module, and provide lists of most components: page setup, 
data sources, data sets, reusable report items, and so on. It also provides a 
list of custom color definitions.</p>

<h4>Name Spaces</h4>

<p>ROM defines a number of <i>name spaces</i> within a report 
design. A name space holds a set of named components. Each name space is 
independent of the other. ROM name spaces are:</p>

  <table class="section-table">
    <thead>
      <tr><td>Name Space</td>
        <td>Contents</td>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tr>
      <td>Styles</td>
      <td>Shared styles</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Data Sources</td>
      <td>Data sources (database connections)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Data Sets</td>
      <td>Queries and other data sources</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Master Pages</td>
      <td>Page definitions.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Layout Elements</td>
      <td>All visual elements such as lists, tables, etc.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Parameters</td>
      <td>Report parameters</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

<p>The name is optional for elements that can appear in the 
Layout Elements name space. The name is required for all other elements.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

in to keep track of the person who wrote the report, or is responsible for 
maintaining the report. This is purely documentation; BIRT does not use this 
property at runtime.</p>

<h2 class="property">base</h2>

<p>A base directory to use when computing relative links from this report.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A base directory to use when computing relative links 
from this report. Most often used for reports created externally to the server 
and submitted on the fly. Used when computing hyperlinks, library includes, 
image includes and other relative file references.  See the W3C XML Base 
standard for background:
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-xmlbase-20010627/">http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-xmlbase-20010627/</a>.

<h2 class="property">includeResource</h2>

<p>Resource file name which stores the externalized strings.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Report designs support externalized strings by storing the resource keys;
which are stored in the resource file. This property stores the resource file
name.</p>

<h3>See Also</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="property">theme</h2>

<p>Specify the theme that is to be used by the design or library.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>When a report/library include another library, it can use one of the theme
provided by the included library. When a theme is applied, the report/library
is able to reuse all the styles contained in this theme.</p>


<h2 class="property">libraries</h2>

<p>Libraries that are included by this module.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Includes a list of libraries.</p>


<h2 class="property">propertyBindings</h2>

<p>Binds a property from an element to an expression.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>There is requirement that a property value for an elemenet can be overridden at runtime. 
This list is used to bind a property of an element to an expression, user can override the 
value if expression bind to an parameter.</p>


<h2 class="property">colorPalette</h2>

<p>A set of custom color names.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The developer can define a set of custom color names as 
part of the design. The developer can then reference these names within 
properties. Defining the colors in the palette helps the developer achieve a 
consistent look throughout the report, and allows colors to be refined by 
changing just one place. </p>

<p>Every custom color has three parts: a display name, an 
internal name and an RGB value. The display name is what the developer sees. If 
the palette will be used by people in different countries, then the display name 
can be externalized and translated. The internal name identifies the color 
within the design and in the XML design file. The internal name cannot be 
localized. Finally, the RGB value gives the actual color.</p>

<p>Custom Color structure</p>

<h2 class="property">comments</h2>

<p>Text that describes the report design.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Text that describes the report design. It can contain 
embedded HTML. The comments are notes for the people who develop and maintain 
the report. Comments cannot be externalized. BIRT does not use this information 
at runtime, it is purely documentation for the report developer.</p>

<h3>See Also</h3>

<p>See the <code>helpGuide</code> and the
<code>description</code> properties for a way to provide 
information for the users of the report.</p>

<h2 class="property">configVars</h2>

<p>List of configuration variables.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Reports frequently have deployment-specific dependencies. For example,
developers often use a test database during development, but target a production
database once the report is deployed. Or, an OEM may use a different company
name in report titles for each of their customers. BIRT provides configuration
variables to support such cases. A configuration variable is a name/value pair.</p>

<h3>See Also</h3>

<p>See the <code>helpGuide</code> and the
<code>description</code> properties for a way to provide 
information for the users of the report.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

by BIRT will contain the text &quot;BIRT Version xxx&quot;. Customers or third parties who 
generate designs can insert their product name here. This is purely a 
documentation property; BIRT does not use it at runtime.</p>

<h2 class="property">description</h2>

<p>A description presented to the end user of report when it is deployed.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="property">images</h2>

<p>A list of images embedded in this report.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A design often uses images. Most images in a report will 
be accessed via a URL, or a file deployed externally to the report. However, 
some reports may want to embed an image directly into the report design. 
Embedded images are especially helpful if a report design is generated in a 
custom application and sent to the server for one-time execution.</p>

<p>Images have a name. The name allows an image item to 
reference the embedded image. Scripts can use the image name to retrieve the 
image from the images array:</p>

<pre class="code-block">var img = report.design.images[&quot;MyImage&quot;]</pre>

<h3>See Also</h3>

<p>Image item</p>

<h2 class="property">units</h2>

<p>Default units to be used for the report design.</p>
