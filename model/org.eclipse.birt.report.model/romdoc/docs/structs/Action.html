<h1>Action</h1>

<p>Defines a hyperlink.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The Action structure defines a hyperlink. There are five 
major kinds of actions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Hyperlink: To an external web site, e-mail system, etc.</li>
<li>Bookmark Link: To a location within this report as specified by a bookmark.</li>
<li>Drill-though: To a location within another report as specified by a bookmark.</li>
</ul>

<p>The drill-though link can link to an existing report, or 
request to run a new report. It can optionally include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Parameters to pass when creating a new report.</li>
<li>A location within the target report as specified by a search.</li>
<li>A location within the target report as specified by a bookmark.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Hyperlink property returns a standard web-style link 
with &quot;http:&quot; or &quot;mailto:&quot; prefix. Expression hyperlinks can include special BIRT 
features (search and so on), but only as encoded into a URL. If the link wants 
to jump to a specific target within the document, encode that target within the 
URL as defined by target document type. (For example: http://foo.com/docs/myDoc.html#myTarget.)</p>

<p>If the user provides a relative URL, it is assumed to be 
relative to the same web server that is being used to view the report. The exact 
semantics are implementation-specific in the open source release. In the 
commercial release, the URL is relative to the web server that hosts 
ActivePortal.</p>

<p>A bookmark link simply identifies a bookmark identified 
within this report. Use the Bookmark property of a report item to create the 
target bookmark.</p>

<h2 class="property">formatType</h2>
<p>Format of the target link.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Format of the target link, can be pdf or html link.</p>

<h2 class="property">linkType</h2>

<p>The kind of link: hyperlink, bookmark link or drill-though.</p>

<h3>Choices</h3>
<ul>
<li>none: No link is defined.</li>
<li>hyperlink: A link to a web page, 
    &quot;mailto:&quot;, or other web resource.</li>
<li>drill-through: A link to another 
    report.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This property identifies the kind of link. The link type 
determines which link properties to use as shown above. The default is a 
hyperlink.</p>

<p>A drill-through is a link to another report. The report 
name is given as a relative or absolute name. If the name is relative, then the 
target document is on the same web (application) server as the current report. 
For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>report1: in the same virtual directory as this report.</li>
<li>../report2: Up one virtual directory from this report.</li>
<li>../summary/report3: In a sibling directory to this report.</li>
<li>/reports/summary/report4: In an absolute location on this web server.</li>
</ul>

<p>The destination can be any type of report as supported by 
the web server interface that receives the link commands. If the destination is 
a BIRT design, the report will be run.</p>

<h3>See Also</h3>

<h2 class="property">targetWindow</h2>

<p>The name of the target browser window for the link.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The name of the target browser window for the link. Used 
only for the Hyperlink and Drill-Through options, ignored for the Bookmark Link 
option. This property is optional.</p>

<h2 class="property">uri</h2>

<p>Expression that provides the web URL.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

Web-style hyperlink and includes http:, mailto: and other URLs. Both relative 
and absolute URLs are allowed. The meaning of relative URL depends on the 
deployment environment.</p>

<p>If the property is not set, then no link is defined, even 
if the link type is set to &quot;Hyperlink.&quot;</p>

<h3>See Also</h3>

<h2 class="property">targetBookmark</h2>

<p>Target bookmark defined within this same report, or another report for a drill-though link.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The target bookmark within this report.</p>

<p>If the link type is bookmark link then the value here 
must match a bookmark defined within the report. If the bookmark target is not 
defined, then the link will do nothing.</p>

<p>If link type is drill-though link then the value here 
must match a bookmark defined within the target report. If the bookmark target 
is not defined, then the drill-though link will display the first page of the 
report.</p>

<p>Report Item <code>bookmark</code> Property</p>

<h2 class="property">reportName</h2>

<p>Name of the target report for a drill-through link.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The name of a document on the same server as this report. 
Can include relative or absolute names. If the suffix is omitted, it is assumed 
to be 1) a BIRT document or 2) a BIRT design. If the report name is blank, then 
the no hyperlink is defined even if the link type is set to Drill-though.</p>

<h3>See Also</h3>

<h2 class="property">paramBindings</h2>

<p>Optional list of parameter bindings for the target. 
Used when the hyperlink is used to run a report.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Optional list of parameter bindings for the target. Used 
when the hyperlink is used to run a report. The bindings evaluate an expression 
within the current report, and bind that value to a report parameter in the 
target report. For example, if the current report is a list of customers, the 
report can include a hyperlink that runs a report that shows any open orders for 
that customer. In this case, the parameter bindings pass the customer ID to the 
target report.</p>

<h3>See Also</h3>

<h2 class="property">search</h2>

<p>An optional set of search criteria for the target report for a drill-though link.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Optional list of search criteria. The report is run (if 
needed) or an existing report is opened. Then, BIRT performs a search on the 
target report based on the search criteria entered here.</p>

<p>For example, if the current report is a list of 
customers, the report can include a hyperlink that links to a report that shows 
open orders for all customer, then search for the customer’s orders. In this 
case, the search criteria look for the customer’s ID within the target report.</p>
