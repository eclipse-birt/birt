/**
 * Base class for all design elements in BIRT. This class provides a number of
 * basic services:
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Meta-data</li>
 * <li>Styles</li>
 * <li>Inheritance</li>
 * <li>Property management</li>
 * <li>Element name</li>
 * <li>Containment</li>
 * <li>Change notification</li>
 * <li>Visitor</li>
 * <li>API handle</li>
 * <li>Semantic state</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The descriptions that follow describe the major operations on this class. All
 * operations that change an element <strong>must </strong> be made though a
 * command. So, if you find a method <code>setMumble( )</code> that is of
 * interest, you must locate (or create) a <code>SetMumble</code> command to
 * perform this operation in a way that can be undone. Also, some of the
 * operations described here are incomplete, in that they handle a task only on
 * this one element. Many tasks must be done on several elements to be complete.
 * For example, if we call the <code>setExtends( )</code> method of element E,
 * we also must cache the inverse relationships in the parent element. This
 * higher-level semantic processing is handled by code above this class.
 * 
 * <h3>Meta-data</h3>
 * 
 * This class stores information that the user enters for a design element.
 * Every element is defined by an <em>element definition </em>. The
 * relationship between an element and element definition is much like that
 * between a object and a class in Java. The element definition defines
 * characteristics of the element, and is fixed by the development team. The
 * element is defined by the user and contains information needed for a
 * particular report.
 * <p>
 * The {@link #getDefn}method provides access to the element definition for the
 * particular element. The returned {@link ElementDefn}object provides access
 * to the properties defined for the element as well as other information.
 * <p>
 * This abstract base class provides operations common to all (or most)
 * elements. The application creates Java subclasses to represent the various
 * kinds of report elements. Those subclasses provide the behavior specific to
 * that element type, usually allocating space for any element slots and
 * providing a callback into the {@link ElementVisitor design visitor}class.
 * <p>
 * See the {@link ElementDefn}class for more information on metadata, including
 * the use of the metadata definition file.
 * <p>
 * Members and classes in the meta-data system include:
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>The {@link #getDefn}method gets the element meta-data.</li>
 * <li>The {@link #getPropertyDefn}method gets the meta-data for a system- or
 * user-defined property.</li>
 * <li>The {@link #validatePropertyValue}method validates a property value
 * using the rules defined in the meta-data for the * property.</li>
 * <li>The {@link ElementDefn}class provides the meta-data for an element
 * type.</li>
 * <li>The {@link ElementPropertyDefn}class provides meta-data for a property.
 * It has two subclasses:
 * {@link org.eclipse.birt.report.model.metadata.SystemPropertyDefn}for
 * built-in properties defined in the meta-data file, and
 * {@link UserPropertyDefn}for user-defined properties.</li>
 * <li>The {@link org.eclipse.birt.report.model.metadata.MetaDataDictionary}
 * singleton class provides information to the meta-data for all elements.</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <h3>Styles</h3>
 * 
 * Many elements have an associated style. Style influence the set of system-
 * defined properties, as described below. They also affect the notification
 * system as described below.
 * <p>
 * This abstract base class provides style support in the handling of property
 * values, notifications and the like. Derived classes add logic to define a
 * named style. The derived class overrides the {@link #getStyle}method to
 * return the style for use by the generic mechanisms.
 * <p>
 * An element that can have a style is called a <em>styled element</em>. The
 * style affects the styled elements in three distinct ways.
 * <ol>
 * <li>The element can include some or all of the properties defined for the
 * style element. The element defines only those that make sense for that
 * element. These <em>style properties</em> appear as if they are properties
 * of the element itself.</li>
 * <li>The element can name a shared style from which to get properties.</li>
 * <li>If element does provide the value for a style property, and the element
 * does not explicitly reference a shared style, then the application will use a
 * <em>property search</em> to find a style implicitly associated with this
 * element. This is a search upward in the containment hierarchy to find either
 * 1) a shared style referenced by a container, or 2) an predefined style
 * associated with the slot or element. For example, a label in a Container in a
 * List's Header slot will use the predefined "list-header" style unless another
 * style is defined on the style or Container.</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * Members and classes in the style system include:
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>The {@link #getStyle}method returns the associated style, if any, for
 * this element as a generic DesignElement.</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <h3>Inheritance</h3>
 * 
 * User-defined elements can extend other elements, but style element is not
 * allowed to extend each other. The following is the terminology used for this
 * system.
 * <ul>
 * <li>If element E extends element D, then D is said to be the
 * <em>parent </em> element, and element E is the <em>derived </em> element.
 * </li>
 * <li>We can also use the term <em>base </em> as a synonym for parent. That
 * is, D is the base element above.</li>
 * <li>Element D may in turn extend another element C.</li>
 * <li>We say that C and D are <em>ancestor </em> elements of E, and that D
 * and E are <em>descendents </em> of C.</li>
 * <li>In this simple hierarchy, element E is the <em>most derived </em>
 * element, while element C is the <em>most base </em> element.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Inheritance applies to the following:
 * <p>
 * <dl>
 * <dt><strong>Property values </strong></dt>
 * <dd>An element inherits any property values defined by any of its ancestors.
 * If two ancestors define values for the same property, then the inherited
 * value is that defined by the most derived ancestor. This rule is similar to
 * the method overriding rules in Java.</dd>
 * 
 * <dt><strong>Named style </strong> </strong></dt>
 * <dd>If an ancestor element explicitly names a style, then the derived
 * element will also use that style (unless the derived element specifies a
 * different style.)</dd>
 * 
 * <dt><strong>Element type </strong> </strong></dt>
 * <dd>Inheritance only works between elements of the same type. One could say
 * that a derived element inherits the element type of the parent element. More
 * precisely, both the parent and derived elements have a type, and the
 * semantics of the application require that the element types be the same. It
 * is an error to extend an element of a different type.</dd>
 * 
 * <dt><strong>User-defined properties </strong> </strong></dt>
 * <dd>The user can define a custom property. All derived elements also have
 * that property.</dd>
 * 
 * <dt><strong>Custom behavior </strong> </strong></dt>
 * <dd>The user can define custom behavior by associating the element with a
 * Java class. Derived elements inherit this behavior.</li>
 * </dl>
 * <p>
 * 
 * Inheritance does <em>not</em>, however, apply to the following:
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 * <li><strong>Name </strong>. A derived element does not inherit the name of
 * the parent component. If it did, then there would be two elements with the
 * same name, violating the rules about element name uniqueness.</li>
 * 
 * <li><strong>Parent element </strong>. A derived element necessarily has a
 * distinct value for the "extends" property than does its parent.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * 
 * Members and classes in the inheritance system include:
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>The {@link #setExtendsElement}method sets the parent element.</li>
 * <li>The {@link #setExtendsName}method sets the name of the parent element.
 * It is used when reading a design file, or if it is necessary to store an
 * unresolved parent name.</li>
 * <li>The {@link #getExtendsElement}method gets the parent element.</li>
 * <li>The {@link #extendsRef}member stores the reference to the parent
 * element.</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <h3>User-Defined Properties</h3>
 * 
 * As noted above, the user can define user-defined properties for an element.
 * User-defined properties have many of the same attributes as system-defined
 * properties. User-defined properties work virtually the same as system-defined
 * properties, including support for localization, for a property type, for
 * validating the property value, and more.
 * <p>
 * Members and classes in the user-defined property system include:
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>The {@link #addUserPropertyDefn}method defines a user-defined property.
 * </li>
 * <li>The {@link #dropUserPropertyDefn}method removes a user-defined
 * property.</li>
 * <li>The {@link #getUserPropertyDefn}method gets the definition of a
 * user-defined property.</li>
 * <li>The {@link UserPropertyDefn}class defines a user-defined property.
 * </li>
 * <li>The {@link #userProperties}member holds the user-defined property
 * definitions for this element.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * See also the meta-data section above for the methods that validate property
 * values, and the property value section below for methods that work with
 * property values.
 * 
 * <h3>Property Values</h3>
 * 
 * See the {@link ElementPropertyDefn}class for a description of the details of
 * property values. Property values are of two key types: normal and intrinsic.
 * Normal properties are stored in the {@link #propValues}member on this class.
 * Intrinsic properties are stored in member variables.
 * <p>
 * Normal properties have two states: <em>set</em> and <em>unset</em>. A
 * property is set on element E if a value for that property appears in the
 * propValues list for element E; otherwise it is unset on element E.
 * <p>
 * Elements inherit property values from their parent elements. So, if property
 * P is unset on element E, E will inherit the value of P from its parent
 * element.
 * <p>
 * The <em>local value</em> of a property for an element E indicates whether
 * or not the property is set on that specific element. The local value is
 * generally of interest only to low-level code. The XML design file shows only
 * the local property values for an element.
 * <p>
 * The <em>effective value </em> of a property provides the value computed
 * using the property search which includes the ancestor elements, styles,
 * context, system-defaults, and other information. The effective value is
 * generally what the user cares about, and is what appears in the property
 * sheet and other UI.
 * <p>
 * Members and classes in the property value system include:
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>The {@link #propValues}member stores the property values set on this
 * element.</li>
 * <li>The {@link #setProperty( String, Object )}method sets a property value
 * on this element.</li>
 * <li>The {@link #clearProperty}method unsets a property value on this
 * method.</li>
 * <li>The {@link #getLocalProperty( ReportDesign, String )}method gets the
 * property value, if any, set on this element.</li>
 * <li>The {@link #getProperty( ReportDesign, String )}method gets the
 * effective value of the property.</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <h3>Element Name</h3>
 * 
 * Elements can have a name. The semantics of the specific element type
 * determine if the element name is optional or required. In a few contexts, the
 * name may be ignored (not supported). The name uniquely identifies an element
 * and is locale-independent. (The display name, described below, is
 * localizable.) Elements with a name can be referenced in the design or in
 * code. Elements without a name can be referenced in code by navigating to the
 * element.
 * <p>
 * If an element has a name, then it resides in a name space. All name spaces
 * reside in the {@link RootElement root element}.
 * <p>
 * An element also has a <em>display name</em> that is shown to the user. The
 * display name is optional, and is represented by a system property value. If
 * not provided, then the user sees the name. The display name is localizable.
 * Localized names are important for elements used in templates when the users
 * of the templates are international.
 * <p>
 * Members and classes in the name system include:
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>The {@link #setName}method.</li>
 * <li>The {@link #getName}method.</li>
 * <li>The {@link NameSpace NameSpace}class.</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <h3>Containment</h3>
 * 
 * The overall report design organizes design elements into a hierarchy. All
 * elements except the report design itself are <em>contained </em> within some
 * other element: the <em>container </em>. The contained element is the
 * <em>content
 * </em>. (Note: the usage of the term container in this
 * discussion is more generic than the Container element in the report design.
 * The Container element is a container, but other elements are as well.)
 * <p>
 * The details of the containment are specific to each element type. For
 * example, a Container element has an ordered list of content elements. The
 * design has a named list of styles, and an ordered list of sections. As a
 * result, the implementation of the container-to-content relationship must be
 * defined in a subclass of this class.
 * <p>
 * However, all content elements have at most one container. And, all elements
 * (except the root) have a container. So, the content-to-container relationship
 * is modelled in this element base class.
 * <p>
 * Containers have one or more <em>slots </em>. See the
 * {@link org.eclipse.birt.report.model.metadata.SlotDefn}class for a detailed
 * description of slots.
 * <p>
 * Members in the containment system include:
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>The {@link #container}member that caches a pointer to the container
 * element.</li>
 * <li>The {@link #getContainer}method to get the container element.</li>
 * <li>The {@link #setContainer}method to set the container element.</li>
 * <li>The {@link #getSlot}method returns a slot within a container.
 * <li>The {@link ContainerSlot},{@link SingleElementSlot}and
 * {@link MultiElementSlot}classes that represent slots.</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <h3>Change Notification</h3>
 * 
 * Any given element may be "visualized" in multiple places in the user
 * interface. If the user changes the element, all the affected parts of the UI
 * must be updated. The notification system is responsible for these updates.
 * <p>
 * The notification system allows any number of {@link Listener}objects to
 * subscribe to receive change notifications for an element. Notifications are
 * sent for each change using subclasses of the {@link NotificationEvent}class.
 * See these two classes for more details.
 * <p>
 * Note: subscribing and unsubscribing listeners is the only mutator operation
 * that the application can (and should) do without the use of a command.
 * <p>
 * Members and classes in the notification system include:
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>The {@link #listeners}member holds the list of subscribed listeners.
 * </li>
 * <li>The {@link #addListener}and {@link #removeListener}methods to add and
 * remove listeners.</li>
 * <li>The {@link Listener}class to receive notifications.</li>
 * <li>A subclass of {@link NotificationEvent}notifies the listener of the
 * type of change, and information about the change.</li>
 * <li>The {@link org.eclipse.birt.report.model.activity.ActivityStack}class
 * triggers the notifications as it processes commands.</li>
 * <li>ActivityStack calls the {@link #sendEvent}method to send the
 * notification to the appropriate listeners.</li>
 * <li>The sendEvent( ) method in turn calls
 * {@link #broadcast(NotificationEvent)}to do the detailed work of sending an
 * event to all the listeners.</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <h3>Element Identity</h3>
 * 
 * There are four ways to refer to an item:
 * <p>
 * <dl>
 * <dt><strong>By name </strong></dt>
 * <dd>Elements can have a name. Names are unique within a name space. However,
 * many elements are anonymous. Names are required only when the element will be
 * referenced. Some elements, such as styles, data sources, and data sets, exist
 * to be referenced and so require a name. Most other elements are seldom
 * referenced, and so the name is optional.</dd>
 * 
 * <dd><strong>By navigation </strong></dt>
 * <dd>Elements can be found via navigation. One can start at the root element
 * and work down though the containment hierarchy. Every valid element can be
 * reached via navigation. Indeed, the definition of element creation, from the
 * perspective of the design, is when the element is added to the containment
 * hierarchy. Similarly, the definition of deletion, again from the perspective
 * of the design, is when the element is dropped from the containment hierarchy.
 * </dd>
 * 
 * <dd><strong>By pointer </strong></dt>
 * <dd>The design tool itself references elements mostly using Java pointers.
 * That is, once the application finds an element of interest, it simply holds
 * onto it using a pointer.</dd>
 * 
 * <dd><strong>By ID </strong></dt>
 * <dd>The web designer needs a simple way to reference items across calls to
 * the server. None of the above is both simple and consistent. Element IDs
 * provide this service. IDs are valid only within a single design "session". A
 * session is the time between when a design is loaded into memory, and the time
 * that the design is released. IDs are <em>not </em> valid across sessions,
 * and are not persistent. The application must enable IDs by calling
 * {@link org.eclipse.birt.report.model.metadata.MetaDataDictionary#enableElementID}.
 * Call {@link #getID}to get the ID of an element. Call
 * {@link RootElement#getElementByID}to obtain and element given an element ID.
 * </dd>
 * </dl>
 * 
 * <h3>Element Visitor</h3>
 * 
 * A visitor class is a design pattern that is useful for implementing certain
 * kinds of algorithms that need to "touch" many different elements. One could
 * code the element by adding methods to each element, but doing so is
 * cumbersome, complex, and error-prone. Better is to define a <em>visitor</em>
 * class that has methods for each element. One simply <em>applies</em> the
 * visitor to an element, and the element then calls its specific "visit" method
 * in the visitor. For example, the design engine uses a visitor to write the
 * design to an XML file.
 * 
 * <h3>API Handles</h3>
 * 
 * This class, and its subclasses, are low-level classes that maintain the state
 * of the design. Property and slot methods are generic so that they work for
 * all elements. Modifications must be done through commands. The application,
 * however, wants to work with a simpler set of objects, and wants to work with
 * specific "getter" methods to get properties. The application also simply
 * wants to call a "setter" method to make a change.
 * <p>
 * The API handle package provides a set of "facade" classes that give this
 * high-level view. Therefore, the application will seldom work with this class
 * directly. Instead, it will work with the handle produced by calling the
 * {@link #getHandle}method.
 * 
 * <h3>Semantic State</h3>
 * 
 * Design elements maintain a wide variety of relationships to other parts of
 * the design. An element refers to its parent element or its shared style.
 * Expressions reference elements, parameters and data set columns. Many
 * elements reference data sources or data sets.
 * <p>
 * <em>Semantic processing</em> resolves name references to the actual
 * elements or other objects. Semantic processing is done incrementally for most
 * operations. However, batch processing is needed when reading a design file
 * and for certain other operations.
 * <p>
 * Semantic processing is done by doing a depth-first traversal of the design
 * tree. Errors are gathered on the design context.
 * <p>
 * The result of semantic processing may be that the design caches a reference
 * to another element as is done in this class for the parent element and the
 * shared style. In other cases, the reference is checked and then discarded.
 * <p>
 * When a reference is cached, the system must handle the case of a reference
 * that cannot be resolved. For example, an element might use a shared style
 * defined in a template, but that shared style has been deleted from the
 * template and can no longer be resolved. In this case, we cache the name until
 * the user loads the required elements, or changes the reference to an existing
 * style. Similar rules apply to the "extends" property.
 *
