/**
 * Writes the design to an XML design file that follows the BIRT design schema.
 * Uses a visitor pattern to traverse each element. BIRT elements support
 * inheritance in several forms. Because of this, the design writer writes only
 * those properties "local" to the element being written -- it does not write
 * inherited properties.
 * <p>
 * Because the XML schema was designed for to be understood by humans, the
 * schema is not a literal representation of the model. Instead, properties are
 * named and grouped in a way that is easiest to explain and understand. This
 * means that the writer has to do a bit more work to write the design, the the
 * extra work here is well worth the savings to the many customers who will read
 * the design format.
