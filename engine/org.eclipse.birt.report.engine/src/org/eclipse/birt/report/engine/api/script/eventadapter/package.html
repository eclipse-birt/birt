This package contains adapters for the event handler interfaces in 
org.eclipse.birt.report.engine.api.script.eventhandler. The adapter classes are empty implementations
of the event handler interfaces. Script developers are encouraged to extend the adapters rather than 
directly implementing the event handler interfaces. If the interfaces are changed, the implementing code
won't break if the adapters are extended.

<h2>Package Specification</h2>
