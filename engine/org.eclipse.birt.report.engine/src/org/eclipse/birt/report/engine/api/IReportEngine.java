/**
 * A report engine provides an entry point for reporting functionalities. It is
 * where the report generation and rendering process are globally customized. It
 * is also the place where engine statistics are collected. Through report
 * engine, reports can be generated and rendered to different output formats.
 * Queries can also be executed for preview purpose without involving a full
 * report generation.
 * <p>
 * Engine supports running different types of tasks. Example tasks include
 * running a report design to generate a report instance file, rendering a
 * report instance to output format, running a report directly to output,
 * running a data set for preview, searching a report, etc.
