This package contains event handler interfaces for the BIRT scripting environment. A script developer would implement
these interfaces when writing script code in Java. Note: It is encouraged to extend the adapters in
org.eclipse.birt.report.engine.api.script.eventadapter, rather than implementaing the event handler
interfaces directly. This way, if the interfaces are changed, the script code will not break.
